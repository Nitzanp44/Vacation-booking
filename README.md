## About The Project
The Vacation booking system connects hosts and customers.
A customer enter their  requests: number of guests, location, price, etc.
If a host has an accommodation unit that complies with customer requests,
he can offer the client to close a vacation with him.
Hosts can add, remove, and update their accommodation units.
The manager can view the customers, hosts and their accommodation units, and orders placed.
